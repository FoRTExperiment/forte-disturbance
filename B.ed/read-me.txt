1.constant_pulse_met.R: sets ED up to run with a series of runs with constant met input + pulses of variable of met to get an understanding of climate impacts. 
1.constant-met-runs.R: sets ED up to run with a constant met input, it is what we are using as the basic experiment for this work. 

2.post_processing.R: this script processes the hdf5 files written out by ED into a rds file per ED run that is easy to downlaod onto a local machine.
