READ ME : this files describes the steps for downloading, processing and setting up the inputs to run 
ED for the forte-disturbence scenarios. 

TO DO 
  1. Start by downloading the NARR-ED2.tar.gz from
    https://github.com/FoRTExperiment/ed4forte/releases/download/met-ed2/NARR-ED2.tar.gz and save as 
    in the forte-disturbance/A.inputs/NARR-ED2-main. 
  2. Source 1A.constant_met_inputs.R on pic, this script will only need to be ran once and will generate a complete set of met inputs for the ED runs. These runs use a constant year of met data from 1900 to 2050. 
  3. If the harvest event files are missing or need to be updated source helper_functions.R

  
  
FILE DESCRIPTIONS
  * READ-ME.txt this file 
  * ED2IN : the ed input file set up for UMBS designed by A. Shiklomanov, downloaded from 
    https://github.com/ashiklom/fortebaseline/blob/master/inst/ED2IN. 
  * events : a directory of harvest event xml files based on the harvest 
             templates (https://github.com/EDmodel/ED2/blob/master/EDTS/Templates/tonzi_harvest.xml) set up to reproduce the FoRTE girdling treatment groups. The events can
	     be manipulated with the 2.create_eventfiles.R 
  * helper_functions.R : functions that can be used to manipulate the NARR files.
  * 1A.constant_met_inputs.R: the script that is used to generate the met ensemble, it only needs to be run once.
  * 1B.summarize_met_information.R: the script that saves the average monthly and annual data and saves them as a csv file.
